To summarize what I did to execute this project:

*  I installed and loaded the packages needed for connection, query, and analysis of the spoonacularAPI. 
*  I then made a connection to the spoonacularAPI and queried the API to return content on multiple criteria of interest. I also saved that content into a more usable data frame for further analysis.   
*  I then created functions that will allow a user to run their own queries of interest on the spoonacularAPI. 
*  Finally, I explored the data frame I made using contingency tables, numeric summaries, and graphical displays of categorical and quantitative data.  

Interesting Findings:

My exploratory analyses generated several interesting findings. The most notable findings were the strong relationship between the amount of fat a recipe had and the number of calories in that recipe. Also interested was the lack of a relationship between protein and carbs. I would have thought that relationship would be at least a bit stonger than it was. This information can be very informative to individuals wanting to better understand the macronutrient breakdown commonly found in Greek recipes. The functions in this documentation can also be easily modified by users wanting to learn about different parameters related to recipes than what I used in the current document. 

Questions:

1. What was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?

The most difficult parts were getting my user function to be modifiable for further use by others, and also making sure I addressed all parts of the rubic related to handling the new repo and submssion process.

3. What would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?

I would first confirm that I can actually find the content that the API documentation told me I would have access to with my pull. I read the documentation and then planned out my analyses in detail only to find that I then had a great deal of trouble actually being able to locate that content. Thankfully with Dr. Post's help I was able to, but without that assistance I could have potentially needed to start over.
